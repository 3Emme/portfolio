## Description

This portfolio was created first as an Epicodus assignment, with the intent to have it serve a long term function for the creator as a landing page for their programming portfolio. For the time being this README will serve as a checklist to demonstrate the satisfaction of all project requirements and objectives.

_Project requirements:

* Create a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS, which will later act as the landing page for your programming portfolio.
  * Do not use a template to create your initial HTML and Bootstrap.
  * Begin your work with an empty page and an initial empty commit.
  * Your CSS stylesheet must be named styles.css and reside in a css directory.
  * Your HTML file page must be called index.html.
* Project includes the following:
  * Your name.
  * An image of you, or something that represents you.
